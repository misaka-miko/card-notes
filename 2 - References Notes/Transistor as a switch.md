# Transistor as a switch
The transistor consists of three terminals: *Drain*, *Gate* and *Source*. Source has the potential and tries to flow to the Drain. But it can't simply reach the drain since there's a gate between them.

The *n-channel* transistor opens when voltage of gate is low, and closed when voltage of gate is higher than voltage of source at some level $\epsilon$. The *p-channel* is the opposite.
