# Basic steps for slip-box note-taking system

1. Make some rough, in other words, *fleeting notes* and place them within a folder whenever you have some *thought* flashing into your mind.
	1. You don't need to write it in formal way, the purpose of fleeting notes is for future *permanent note* writing.
2. Make *literature notes*, containing some quotes of what you read.
	1. You should not simply copy the quotes. Instead, you should translate them into your own words.
	2. What you quote should not be too much, they should be highly selective.
	3. Write in more formal way, including the *references* and write in full sentences.
3. Make *permanent notes*, look into the slip-box and develop arguments based on the notes token in *step one* and *step two*. You should not simply collect ideas, but consider the relevance to your own research, thinking or interests.
4. Add the *permanent notes* to slip-box and add links to relevant notes.
5. Develop various topics based on the permanent notes. Don't try to brainstorm for a topic, and **instead** you should use your slip-box to see how your notes developed and where they direct.
6. Turn the notes into a draft and then turn it to a full paper. In each step, translate the words into more comprehensive expressions, detecting the missing arguments, going back to reading and back again to finish the work.
