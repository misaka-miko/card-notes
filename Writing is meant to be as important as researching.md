# Writing is meant to be as important as researching
As opposed to the writing tasks distributed in the stage of *middle* school or
*primary* school, which serves to be only handed to the teacher, the writing in
*university* is meant to be published, at least discussed with the colleagues and the 
professors. Therefore the writing we do in the stage of university should be based
on facts, because truth stays there regardless of who writes it. 

As a result, the presentation of the knowledge, namely publishing writing, **should not** be separated from the production of the knowledge. In terms of the principle, writing holds the same importance as research itself.
